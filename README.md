The SXSW Hackathon (formerly the SXSW Music Hackathon) is 24 straight hours of buzzing, high-tech creativity as music, VR/AR, and film hacker/creators use their programming knowledge and our collection of music, visual APIs, and coding assets to develop their industry-changing prototypes and compete for cash prizes, awarded by our panel of celebrity judges.

At Cloudinary, we believe images and visuals greatly enhance the user experience of music and video. As a powerful API for media management, we let developers handle images, videos, audio and emerging media types. End-to-end automation includes media selection, upload, analysis, administration, manipulation, optimization and delivery. 

We're hackers too, so we know your time at the hackathon is limited. That's why we've developed this guide to help you harness our technology to realize your ideas in the most efficient way possible.

**Challenge:**

Build and demonstrate the best use of Cloudinary in your hack to win fun prizes.

**Prizes:**

* 1-year _Cloudinary Plus_ plan \($1068 value\) award to the hack team chosen as _best use of Cloudinary API_.
* The most creative hack projects (that make use of Cloudinary API) will be featured on our Blog.

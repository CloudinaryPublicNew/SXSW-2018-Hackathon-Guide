#Build a Music Discovery API
By Dan Zeitman

In this Step-By-Step Guide we'll show you how to build an API wrapper for multiple web services in order to create a music discovery service backend.

We're going to build a series of api endpoints that will be hosted on Auth0's Webtask.  The design pattern is based off Express so it will be familiar to many.


> Setup:  [Signup for Auth0's Webtask service](https://webtask.io/make)

Once you've logged in create an empty task and run it to get familiar with the  platform and editor.

Create a new task called: 
> music-discovery-service

[Copy the source code of our Music Discovery Service API](https://github.com/cloudinary-developers/sxsw-hackathon/blob/master/sxsw-7-digital.js)

Add The Secrets
Add the NPM Modules
Test The service
